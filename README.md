_**KEY INSIGHTS**_

- The tree map shows manufacturing industry and the government as first with 1035 job positions utilizing AI.
- The doughnut chart shows that there is an almost equal adoption of remote, hybrid and onsite work models by different companies around the world, with 5034 companies adopting to full remote working.
- The bar chart shows 8354 AI jobs being in the 16,621 to 116,620 salary range per annum.

- The world map captures Switzerland as the highest with an average salary of 172,995 USD per annum.


**RECOMMENDATIONS**

- Real estate has ranked the least in the integration of AI therefore the need to set aside funds for extensive research purposes in order to find a bridge that leverages artificial intelligence hence increasing the need of skilled AI personnel promoting the employment sector and advancing the real estate industry through automation processes and rapid generation of information such prediction growth of real estate within the next five years.
- The manufacturing industry topped the list having the highest integration of AI, the skill set required in this industry could be the force behind its rapid integration therefore such can be studied and then applied in other industries, even better it can be an inspiration to an innovation in another industry.
- Most companies fully adopted the remote work model with still a big number using the onsite work model, hence companies that are fully remote need to be further analyzed in order to have a breakdown of their performances in terms of revenue generation, employees productivity and company efficiency.
- Switzerland has the highest AI jobs with salaries ranging between 116,621 to 216,620 USD, factors that favor this range in average salary need to investigated in order to be leveraged in different locations across the world.
With the rapid advancement of AI and ML, it is then wise for companies to ensure they are caught up with the latest trends and their systems up-to-date together with data analytics enthusiasts.

**CONCLUSION**

Integration of Artificial Intelligence into different industries has resulted to an increase of AI skilled job positions and due to its rapid advancement it is therefore encouraged for data enthusiasts to continually upskill in order to stand out in the competitive job market.
